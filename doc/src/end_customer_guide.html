  <h3>Audience</h3>
  <p>This guide is written those administering Brightgate-secured networks
    appliance during our Beta program.</p>
  <h2 id="why-brightgate">Why Brightgate</h2>
  <p>Business networks are under attack. And attacks are becoming both more
    frequent and more automated. As a result, your data—the lifeblood of your
    business, from accounts receivable to contracts to your customer's data
    <i>and</i>
    the devices that process it—present an ever-increasing risk. While big
    enterprises can spend millions on a team of IT experts, and the systems
    those experts require, small businesses don't have that kind of budget or
    technical knowledge, increasingly leading hackers to target small
    business. Small businesses need an automated response to fend off bots,
    phishing, viruses, ransomware, exfiltration, and malware. That’s why small
    businesses need precisely the type of platform that we’ve developed at
    Brightgate: one that enables automated protection to prevent bad actors
    from misusing both your networks and the resources they connect. </p>
  <h3 id="the-power-of-machine-learning">Harness the power of machine learning
  </h3>
  <p>Brightgate observes your devices and their behavior all the time when
    they are on the network. Our machine learning creates a model of usual
    behavior on your network, so odd behavior is immediately identified. But
    we don’t stop with simply identifying odd behavior. We move a potentially
    infected device into quarantine to prevent it from infecting other devices
    on the network, then limit its network access until the issue is resolved.
    In addition, we notify the device's owner and network administrator of the
    issue, using language that’s easily understood, and suggest appropriate
    actions to take so the device can be safely updated or sanitized and again
    permitted access to the network. We'll even help you with remote IT to
    resolve the problem. Brightgate also blocks online destinations that we
    know are bad news—phishing, malware, and spyware. The Brightgate security
    team also stays on top of the latest threats. We automatically update
    every platform to defend against each new threat, covering your entire
    network—all your devices—all the time.</p>
  <h3 id="protect-your-data">Protect your data</h3>
  <p>Brightgate gets it. Small businesses like yours are very good at the
    skills your business was founded on—whether it’s designing systems,
    serving a meal, or offering consulting services. The core competence of
    your business is not in network security, but <b>ours is</b>. We
    understand that you need to adopt technologies that matter to your
    business without fear that you're putting your business at risk. As the
    technology you adopt becomes more sophisticated and interconnected, your
    risk of exposure to bad actors increases. Cybersecurity should, then, be a
    critical part of your technology focus. Until now, though, this has not
    been the case. Network security has been, at best, an afterthought as
    cybersecurity offerings have been both too complex and too expensive, and
    many small business owners like you have been unable to find a solution
    that scales appropriately, focusing too much either on home user needs or
    on enterprise requirements.</p>
  <h3 id="easy-onboarding">Easy onboarding</h3>
  <p>Brightgate solves the problem of overly complex solutions with an
    intelligent, easy-to-use solution that secures your network. We use a
    simple approach to configuration and onboarding, automating most decisions
    and implementation. This removes the need for highly technical, expensive
    staff. Our simple subscription model make your network security spend more
    efficient. And, our technology scales to your business, hitting the sweet
    spot between a home office and a large enterprise.</p>
  <h3 id="constant-monitoring">Constant monitoring, immediate notification</h3>
  <p>With Brightgate, you know which devices are on your network; what those
    devices are doing on the Internet, whether data is being passed out of
    your network, and to where; whether devices on your network are using a
    default password; and who has been provided guest network access.
    Importantly, Brightgate technology quarantines devices that are acting out
    of character, protecting your network from infection. We also notice if
    data has been or is being sent to known bad actors, and we can identify
    the amount of data sent.</p>
  <h3 id="ease-ofuse">Ease of use</h3>
  <p>Brightgate is designed to ensure your business can easily reap the
    benefits of automated cybersecurity. The simplicity of managing our
    cybersecurity solution, with alerts that make the issue easy to understand
    and specify the level of urgency, makes Brightgate’s technology easy to
    administer. </p>
  <p>Your Brightgate appliance helps you easily and quickly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add people and their devices to your network</li>
    <li>Terminate network access</li>
    <li>Grant temporary (“guest”) network access</li>
    <li>Identify devices that are acting suspiciously to reduce cybersecurity
      risks</li>
    <li>Protect your network from suspicious behavior</li>
    <li>Audit your network for compliance</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="prevent-ransomware-attacks">Prevent ransomware attacks</h3>
  <p>Besides the potential privacy issues, if your data is being held for
    ransom, reconstructing your data can be almost impossible and the ransom
    itself may be excruciatingly expensive. Brightgate is a valued partner to
    small businesses like yours searching for a zero administration answer to
    today’s cybersecurity risks.</p>
  <h2 id="how-we-secure">How we secure your business and customers</h2>
  <p> We built our product from the ground up, after extensive research, to
    ensure that a cybersecurity platform used by small businesses would be
    both easy to use and easy to administer. A couple of key ideas informed
    our design:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Access:</b> What devices should have access to this device access?
      And, looking at it from the opposite angle, what devices should this
      have device have access to?</li>
    <li><b>Trust:</b> How much do you trust this device when it's on your
      network?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We recognized that building a secure network means that devices
    fulfilling different functions in your business should be provided
    different types of access to one another. It's fundamental to our design:
    access is given where it's needed. Sometimes that's one-way. Important
    computers should be able to configure a thermostat, for example, but that
    thermostat shouldn't be allowed to attack those computers.</p>
  <p>Next, we designed a more secure method of authorizing devices to use your
    networks. We make it easy for every employee to have their own username
    and password to connect devices like laptops, tablets, or phones. Devices
    that share a common Wi-Fi password, like thermostats or light switches,
    are on a separate network.</p>
  <p>The end result? We created <b><i>trust groups</i></b></p>
  <h3 id="trust-groups">Trust groups</h3>
  <p>The Brightgate platform assigns each device connected to your network
    into a <b>trust group</b>—a logical grouping of connected devices. We
    make it easy to manage your network by providing default trust groups and
    automating trust group assignment of every device.</p>
  <p>Trust groups are how we protect the devices on your network and reduce
    the risk that malware or viruses will spread. The trust group to which a
    device is assigned affects both the level of trust for this device and the
    device's access to to other devices when it is on your network. Devices
    within a trust group communicate with and have access both to other
    devices assigned to that trust group and to devices assigned to trust
    groups that are less trusted and known.</p>
  <p>The less we know and trust a device, the less access we should give that
    device. That keeps untrusted devices from accessing or attacking other
    devices on your network.</p>
  <h4 id="network-authentication-and-trust-groups">Network authentication and
    trust groups work together</h4>
  <p>The way you add a device to your network affects the trust group we
    assign that device into. Think of it this way: phones and laptops owned by
    employees present a different type of risk than a Wi-Fi enabled
    thermostat. While the various types of authentication are beyond the scope
    of this guide, it's helpful to understand that Brightgate supports
    different types of network authentication, which all use WPA2. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>An Authorized User network that uses Extensible Authentication
      Protocol (EAP). With this type of network, each network user has their
      own login ID and password. You can read more about EAP in this <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Authentication_Protocol">helpful
        article from Wikipedia</a></li>
    <li>A Devices network that uses Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication. With
      this type of network, all network users share the same password. A
      pre-shared key (PSK) allows anyone who has the key to use the wireless
      network.</li>
    <li>A Guest network. With this type of network, a network user does not
      need a login ID, but is provided a password that periodically expires.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We recommend including the
    suffix in the network name so it is clear to people choosing from among
    them when adding a device or logging on for the first time. For example,
    Acme Corp would name the
    networks<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Acme-users</code>,<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Acme-device</code>,
    and<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Acme-guest</code><span>&nbsp;</span>when first
    setting up their network. During the Beta program, Brightgate will set up
    your networks following this recommendation.</p>
  <h3 id="automated-trust-group-assignment">Automated trust group assignment
  </h3>
  <p>Brightgate automatically assigns each device to a network and trust
    group, following security policies that make sense based on the device’s
    function; thermostats, security cameras, and other Internet-enabled tools
    serve your organization in one way—phones and laptops serve your
    organization in an entirely different way. Each of these devices presents
    a different type of risk and requires a different ability to communicate
    with other devices. The result? We’ll assign them to different trust
    groups.</p>
  <p>Our assignment of devices into a trust group is the result of thoughtful
    planning, from both usability and security perspectives. A network
    administrator's laptop, for example, must be able to communicate with a
    Wi-Fi enabled thermostat to set it up properly, so the thermostat must be
    accessible to the laptop that wishes to use it. When a device is added to
    your network, Brightgate uses the type of authentication provided by the
    device as part of the process to assign it to a trust group. If that
    assignment doesn't suit your company policies, you can move the device as
    discussed in the section <a href="#change-device-trust-group">Change a
      device's trust group assignment</a>.</p>
  <p>A Wi-Fi enabled thermostat is a good example of why assignment into a
    trust group makes your network safer. You want a thermostat to be
    available to a known and trusted employee device, but you likely don't
    want a laptop assigned the <code>guest</code> trust group to communicate
    to that same thermostat. This makes sense—you typically don’t want guests
    adjusting your thermostat, nor do you want guest laptops communicating
    with and potentially infecting devices that you already trust. Moreover,
    the thermostat's <code>devices</code> trust group means that a rogue
    thermostat won't be attacking either guest or employee devices.</p>
  <p>The <code>core</code> trust group is most typically populated with
    devices owned by network administrators or devices that are critical to
    your business. Devices assigned to the <code>standard</code> trust group
    are typically employee laptops and phones. In this setup, should an
    employee laptop become infected with malware, that laptop will never be
    able to infect the network administrator devices in the <code>core</code>
    trust group. And the moment that laptop starts acting oddly, Brightgate
    moves it to <code>quarantine</code>, so it can't infect the devices in
    the <code>standard</code> trust group either.</p>
  <p>Devices that aren’t assigned to a trust group are <code>unenrolled</code>,
    which means they have not been explicitly granted access to the network.
    They will not have credentials or be able to use your network. The most
    common unenrolled devices will be IoT devices that have the correct shared
    Wi-Fi password (PSK) but have not been authorized by an administrator. To
    keep your network secure, we only permit network access to devices that
    have been assigned into a Brightgate trust group. This way, we can
    determine how trusted or known the device is, assign it to an appropriate
    trust group, and watch the device's behavior to keep your network secure.
  </p>
  <p>Devices added to the Authorized User network are automatically added to
    the <code>standard</code> trust group, though administrators may move
    them to a different trust group, as discussed in the section <a
      href="#change-device-trust-group">Change
      a device's trust group assignment</a>. Devices added to the Devices
    network are automatically assigned to the <code>devices</code> trust
    group. And guests are assigned to the <code>guest</code> trust group.</p>

  <h4 id="default-trust-groups">Default trust groups</h4>
  <p>The Brightgate appliance provides a default set of trust groups, so
    network administration isn’t a chore. During the Beta program, the
    default trust group is the trust group into which a device is initially
    enrolled. Devices authenticated using EAP are automatically added to the
    <code>standard</code>
    trust group. Devices authenticated using PSK are automatically assigned to
    the <code>devices</code> trust group. Administrators can move devices to
    a different trust group, as discussed in the section <a
      href="#change-device-trust-group">Change
      a device's trust group assignment</a>.</p>
  <p>View the default trust groups for your network as discussed in the
    section <a href="#network-configuration">View your Network Details</a>,
    which lists the <i>Trust Group Configuration for each network</i>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For the <code>*-users</code> network:
      <ul>
        <li><code>core</code>: The trust group reserved for the most trusted
          devices</li>
        <li><code>standard</code>: The trust group most appropriate for
          devices owned by regular members of your team</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For the <code>*-device </code>network:
      <ul>
        <li><code>devices</code>: The trust group for Internet of Things (IoT)
          devices, such as thermostats or security cameras</li>
        <li><code>quarantine</code>: The trust group for devices that are
          behaving oddly</li>
        <li><code>unenrolled</code>: The trust group for all manually
          configured IoT devices or other unknown devices.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For the <code>*-guest</code> network:
      <ul>
        <li><code>guest</code>: The trust group for devices that require
          temporary network access</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="quarantined-devices">Quarantined devices</h3>
  <p>Quarantined devices are separated from other devices on your network to
    prevent potential infection and maintain security. Quarantine serves as a
    virtual “jail”. It’s where we put devices that look like they might be
    infected with a virus or bot. In short, we’re preventing devices that
    exhibit odd or suspicious behavior from communicating with the Internet as
    well as with other devices on your network. Quarantine stops devices from
    infecting other devices, allowing you to investigate them (with our
    helpful suggestions) and fix the issue at hand.</p>
  <p>For example, if a thermostat assigned to the <code>devices</code> trust
    group begins slowly dripping data to a URL with an unusual address or if
    an automated security check of a laptop fails, the suspicious device is
    automatically removed from its assigned trust group and moved to
    <code>quarantine</code>.</p>
  <p>You’ll get an alert when a vulnerability is identified and we'll move the
    affected device into quarantine. We’ll also include information about why
    we moved the device into quarantine. Once the identified issue is
    resolved, the device is returned to the network and its previously
    assigned trust group.</p>
  <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
  <p>Administering networks managed by Brightgate doesn't require constant
    oversight because we're doing so much behind the scenes. We're constantly
    monitoring your network and device behavior for vulnerabilities as well as
    managing the trust group assignment for your devices. As a result, with
    Brightgate, administration of your network involves the following tasks:</p>

  <h3 id="set-up-your-account">Set up your account</h3>
  <p>To manage networks and add devices, you'll first need to create an account
    in the Brightgate management app, if you don't have one already. For more
    information about how the Brightgate management app is organized, you can
    read more in the section devoted to <a
      href="#the-brightgate-management-app">the Brightgate management app</a>.
  </p>
  <p>The Brightgate management app supports Google Sign-In and Sign-In with
    Microsoft. <b>Note:</b> During the Beta program, Google Sign-In and
    Sign-In with Microsoft are supported for user logins. Other identity
    providers will be available in future releases.</p>
  <p>When you're logging in to the Brightgate management app, we authenticate
    you using your Google or Microsoft account, then walk you through creating
    and storing a Wi-Fi user name and password. You need to store your
    Wi-Fi user name and password to add your devices to the Wi-Fi network for
    authenticated users. <b>Note:</b> The authenticated users network
    typically ends with <code>-users</code>; ask your network administrator
    if you're not sure of the network name.</p>

    alt="Change the Brightgate appliance name">
  <h3 id="set-up-your-networks">Set up your networks</h3>
  <p>To start using the security features of the Brightgate appliance, set up
    your Wi-Fi networks. If you want to continue using existing network names,
    we'll overlay the existing Wi-Fi networks for you during the Beta program,
    but it's helpful to know the overall process.</p>
  <p>Start by deciding whether you're:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating a new Wi-Fi network. If you've never had a network at this
      location, follow the instructions to <a href="#create-new-network">create
        a new network</a>.</li>
    <li>Replacing an existing Wi-Fi network. If you're replacing an existing
      network, decide whether to reuse the network name and
      password based on the level to which you trust the current network.
      If you trust what you've administered previously, then
      reuse the network name and password. If you're uncertain, it's more
      secure to create a new network name and password. During the Beta
      program, overlaying an existing Wi-Fi network requires Brightgate support.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The network name is also called a Service Set ID (SSID). If you don't

  <p>This graphic illustrates the basic process of deciding how to set up your
    network:</p>
  <p><img src="./images/setup_flow.png" alt="Setup process for administrators">
  </p>
  <p>As discussed in <a href="#network-authentication-and-trust-groups">network
      authentication and trust groups work together</a>, Brightgate creates
    three networks based on the method a device uses to authenticate to the
    network: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>User:</b> each network user has their own login ID and password.</li>
    <li><b>Device:</b> all network users share the same password.</li>
    <li><b>Guest:</b> a network user does not need a login ID, but is provided
      a password that periodically rotates.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="create-new-network">Create a new network</h4>
  <p>When you first set up your Brightgate appliance, name each
    network to reflect the SSID, or network name, that you would like to use
    at your site. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Log in to the Brightgate management app</li>
    <li>(Optional) Select your site</li>
    <li>Select <b>Networks</b> to view the complete list of
      Brightgate-secured networks. <b>Note:</b> The default network names are
      <code>setme-users</code>, <code>setme-devices</code>, and
      <code>setme-guest</code>.</li>
    <li>Click the network or the right-facing arrow (&gt;) to display <b>Network
        Details</b>. </li>
    <li>Select the red <b>Settings</b> icon <img
        src="./images/settings-icon.png" alt="Settings icon">.</li>
    <li>Edit the <b>SSID (Network Name)</b> to the name you'd prefer, then
      press <b>SAVE</b>. <b>Note:</b> Maintain the suffix of
      <code>-users</code>, <code>-devices</code>, and <code>-guest</code> to
      more
      easily differentiate among your Brightgate-secured networks.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="add-devices">Add devices</h3>
  <p>Add devices that use the Wi-Fi user name and password created in the
    Brightgate management app, such as a laptop, phone, or tablet, to the
    authenticated users network. <b>Note:</b> The authenticated users network
    typically ends with <code>-users</code>; ask your network administrator
    if you're not sure of the network name. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#add-mac-network">Add an Apple computer</a></li>

  <h2>Brightgate Basics</h2>
  <h3 id="the-brightgate-management-app">The Brightgate management app</h3>
  <p>The Brightgate management app provides all the information you need to
    administer and secure your network. Access the management app by pointing
    your web browser to <a
      href="https://svc1.b10e.net">https://svc1.b10e.net</a>. The Brightgate
    management app is optimized for viewing on any device. On smaller screens,
    the left pane options are provided using the hamburger menu in the top left
    of the screen. </p>
  <p>Once logged in, you can view your account details, open the Brightgate
    Admin Guide, select your site (only if you have multiple sites
    to manage), request support, or log out. If you are administering only one
    site, you'll see these options immediately upon logging in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Serious Alerts:</i> Alerts of detected vulnerabilities are visible
      immediately when you log in. This section displays only if
      a high priority alert (such as a detected security vulnerability) is open.
    </li>
    <li>Organization, a button that activates a list of organizations you
      manage.<b>Note:</b> If you do not manage multiple organizations, this

    search function.</p>
  <h3 id="organizations-and-sites">Organizations and Sites</h3>
  <i>The following sections apply only if you are managing multiple
    organizations.</i>
  <p>A Managed Service Provider (MSP) securing networks deploying Brightgate
    needs to manage networks for multiple clients using the Brighgate management
    app. These clients may have installed the Brightgate appliance at one or
    more sites. The following diagrams illustrate an MSP that manages
    Brightgate-secured networks for multiple clients, one of which has
    multiple sites.</p>
  <p>Brightgate support first establishes the MSP as an organization.
    <b>Note:</b> During the Beta program, Brightgate support will establish
    the MSP and its relationship to client organizations and sites. </p>
  <p><img src="./images/MSP-as-org.png" alt="Management organization"></p>
  <p>Then Brightgate support associates the MSP organization with the clients
    that the MSP manages.</p>
  <p><img src="./images/MSP-with-clients.png" alt="Add MSP clients"></p>
  <p>As sites are created for the client organization, the MSP automatically
    gains access to manage them.</p>
  <p><img src="./images/MSP-with-clients-and-sites.png" alt="MSP with clients and
      multiple client sites"></p>
  <p>Note that in many cases, an MSP may also may have their own collection of
    Brightgate sites; they can manage their clients' networks and their own
    using a single interface.</p>
  <p>In the Brightgate management app, if you manage multiple organizations,
    switch among them by clicking the <b>Organization button</b> at the top
    left, then selecting the correct organization from the displayed list.</p>

  </ol>
  <p><img src="./images/indicators.png" alt="Indicators"></p>
  <p>Use the LEDs as a visual indication of appliance status:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the Network LED is not lit (Indicator C), then the appliance is not
      attached to the cable modem and does not have an IP address. If the
      network LED is blinking (not solid), then the appliance may not be able
      to connect to the outside world. Check the cable modem to see if it
      indicates a live connection to the internet. If the cable modem does not
      have a live connection to the internet, please contact your ISP. If a live
      connection is present, please contact Brightgate support.</li>
    <li>If the Brightgate LED is not lit (Indicator D), then the appliance has
      not been powered on, or is still in the process of initializing the
      hardware. If the Brightgate LED is blinking, then the appliance is
      powering on and finalizing configuration. A blinking LED is expected
      during initial boot.</li>
    <li> If the WAN LED is not lit (Indicator G), then the appliance does not
      have a connection to the cable modem or upstream router. If the WAN LED
      is blinking, traffic is flowing to and from the WAN. A solid LED
      indicates
      that traffic is neither being sent nor received.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Power, Network, and Brightgate LEDs on the top row blink off,
    then on during the appliance boot sequence. If these three LEDs remain
    solidly on, but the Wi-Fi and network port LEDs show no activity, please
    reboot the appliance. If a reboot of the appliance doesn't resolve the LEDs
    from solid to blinking, please contact Brightgate support.
  </p>
  <h4 id="quick-word-certificates">A quick word about certificates</h4>
  <p>When connecting your device to the authenticated users network for the
    first time and periodically when the certificate requires renewal, the
    device may present a certificate for you to accept. This certificate
    confirms the network is what it says it is, and accepting the certificate
    allows you to trust this network without manual intervention whenever you
    connect the device in the future.</p>
  <p>While your network administration team is best qualified to help you
    understand how certificates are used in your environment, Brightgate
    suggests you inspect any certificate before adding it to your device.
    While
    the method of inspection varies according to the device type, ensure the
    certificate is issued by Let's Encrypt, the certificate authority used by
    Brightgate, and that the Subject Name looks like
    <code><i>number</i>.brightgate.net</code>, where
    <code><i>number</i></code>
    is a five digit number. The Trust level should be set to <i>Always
      Trust</i>
    for <b>EAP</b> and <b>Basic Policy</b>, if that level of specificity is
    available on your device. </p>
  <h2 id="secure-your-networks">Secure your networks</h2>
  <p>Brightgate secures your networks automatically, working in the background
    scanning every device added to your Brightgate networks, all the time. As
    a result, administrators don't need to actively secure a Brightgate
    network—compliance with security policies is enforced through the process
    of authenticating users, then adding their devices to the network as well
    as during our constant vigilance of network activity—unless alerted to do
    so by the Brightgate appliance. This type of alert occurs if we find a
    device is in violation of security policies, or acting oddly, as discussed
    in <a href="#remediate-threats">remediate threats</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="device-details">View device details</h3>
  <p>Brightgate supplies details specific to each device on the network. Access
    this information directly by clicking the alert when you first log in or,
    from the main menu, <i>select site &gt; Devices &gt; select device name.</i>
  </p>
  <p>Details for each device on the network display, specifying if Brightgate
    has identified any vulnerabilities. In this example, the device is using a
    password that exposes both the device and network to potential attack.
    Brightgate suggests a remedy, with helpful links to further information if
    you'd like to know more about the issue. We also specify the time the
    vulnerability was identified and when a repair, if any, was executed.</p>
  <p>Also confirm the network details for this device, including the:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>device's name on the network</li>
    <li>network to which the device is connected</li>
    <li>device's IPv4 address</li>
    <li>device's hardware address</li>
    <li>time and date of Brightgate's most recent vulnerability scan for this
      device</li>

  <h3 id="view-devices-network">View devices on the network</h3>
  <p>To view devices on your network, from the main menu, <i>select your

    the active and inactive devices enrolled across the Brightgate-secured
    networks for your organization.</p>
  <p><img src="./images/manage-devices.png" alt="Manage devices"></p>
  <h3 id="remove-devices">Remove devices</h3>
  <p>Brightgate tracks device behavior based on those that are authenticated
    to the network. As a result, devices are not explicitly removed from a
    Brightgate network. Instead, the credentials used to add the device to the
    network must be revoked. </p>
  <p>In a future release, the Wi-Fi user name and password associated with the
    user who added the device to network will be revoked when their Google
    credentials expire, which will prevent the device from being added to the
    network with credentials that are no longer in use by the organization.
    <b><br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Note: </b>If the removal of a device is required, move the device to
    the <code>unenrolled</code> trust group as described in the section <a
      href="#change-device-trust-group">Change
      a device's trust group assignment</a> or contact Brightgate support for
    assistance.</p>
  <h3 id="change-device-trust-group">Change a device's trust group assignment
  </h3>
  <p>Trust groups are how Brightgate protects the devices on your network and
    reduces the risk that malware or viruses will spread. The trust group to
    which a device is assigned affects both the level of trust for this device
    and the device's access to to other devices when it is on your network.
    Devices within a trust group communicate with and have access to both
    other devices assigned to that trust group and devices assigned to trust
    groups that are less trusted and known.</p>
  <p>Devices that aren’t assigned to a trust group are <code>unenrolled</code>,
    which means they have not been explicitly granted access to the network.
    They will not have credentials or be able to use your network. The most
    common <code>unenrolled</code> devices will be IoT devices that have the
    correct
    shared Wi-Fi password (PSK) but have not been authorized by an
    administrator. To keep your network secure, Brightgate only permits network
    access to devices that have been assigned into a Brightgate trust group.
    This way, we can determine how trusted or known the device is, assign it to
    an appropriate trust group, and watch the device's behavior to keep your
    network secure.
  </p>
  <p><b>Important:</b> During the Beta program, all devices added to the
    <code>*-device</code> network will be assigned to the
    <code>unenrolled</code> trust group. Administrators will need to explicitly
    move devices to the
    appropriate trust group to approve the addition of a device to this network.
  </p>
  <p>The trust group and their intended purpose are as
    follows:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><code>core</code>:</dt>
    <dd>The trust group reserved for the most trusted devices.</dd>
    <dt><code>devices</code>:</dt>
    <dd>The trust group for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as
      thermostats or security cameras</dd>
    <dt><code>guest</code>:</dt>
    <dd>The trust group for devices that require temporary network access</dd>
    <dt><code>quarantine</code>:</dt>
    <dd>The trust group for devices that are behaving oddly</dd>
    <dt><code>standard</code>:</dt>
    <dd>The trust group most appropriate for devices owned by regular members
      of your team</dd>
    <dt><code>unenrolled</code>:</dt>
    <dd>The trust group for all manually configured IoT devices or other
      unknown devices.</dd>
    <dt><code>internal</code>:</dt>
    <dd>Reserved for Brightgate use.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>Trust groups may be changed for devices connected to both the wired port
    and devices connected to the Wi-Fi network.</p>
  <p>To change the trust group assignment for a device connected to the Wi-Fi
    network:

      only by an account with administrator role privileges.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4 id="grant-admin-privileges">Grant administrative account privileges</h4>
  <p>An account with administrative privileges may grant administrative
    privileges to an account that has already been created in the Brightgate
    cloud. To grant administrative privileges:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>From the main menu, select <i>Accounts</i></li>
    <li>Click the account to which you are granting administrative privileges

  <p><img src="./images/account-details.png" alt="Account details"></p>
  <h4 id="deprovision-account">Deprovision an account</h4>
  <p>For users who are taking an extended leave and whose accounts will not
    require access
    to the network, but will need access in the future, Brightgate provides
    the ability for administrators to deprovision accounts. Deprovisioning
    an account removes the Wi-Fi credentials associated with the account,
    eliminating the ability to log in
    to the network. A deprovisioned account may, in the future, log back in
    using
    their Google or Microsoft credentials and reprovision themselves using the
    steps outlined in <a href="#set-up-your-account">set up your account</a>.
  </p>
  <p>To deprovision an account:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>From the main menu, select <i>Accounts</i>.</li>
    <li>Click the account to deprovision</li>
    <li>Click <b>DEPROVISION</b></li>
  </ol>
  <h4 id="delete-account">Delete an account</h4>
  <p>For accounts that must be removed from the network, and will not need
    access in the future, Brightgate provides the ability for
    administrators to delete accounts. Deleting an account removes the Wi-Fi
    credentials, eliminating
    the ability to log in to the network. The affected Brightgate cloud
    account will be removed and Brightgate will no longer bill for this
    account.</p>
  <p>To delete an account:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>From the main menu, select <i>Accounts</i>.</li>
    <li>Click the account to delete</li>
    <li>Click <b>DELETE</b></li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="site-specific-admin">Site-Specific Administrators</h3>
  <p>In certain circumstances, an administrator may need direct
    access to the local appliance, such as when Internet connectivity is
    lost and logging in as a Brightgate cloud user would fail. </p>
  <p>To manage site-specific administrators, from the main menu,
    <i>select your site > Users.</i></p>
  <p> Additional site-specific administrators may be added by using the
    + icon at the bottom of the list; however, during the Beta program, please
    contact Brightgate support for assistance if this type of user is
    required.</p>
