    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>This guide is written primarily for those administering the Brightgate
      appliance during our Alpha program; end user content is included either to
      be provided directly to your end users or to use as an aid in creating
      online help.</p>
    <h2 id="why-brightgate">Why Brightgate</h2>
    <p>Business networks are under attack. And attacks are becoming both more
      frequent and more automated. As a result, your data—the lifeblood of your
      business, from accounts receivable to contracts to your customer's data <i>and</i>
      the devices that process it—present an ever-increasing risk. While big
      enterprises can spend millions on a team of IT experts, and the systems
      those experts require, small businesses don't have that kind of budget or
      technical knowledge, increasingly leading hackers to target small
      business. Small businesses need an automated response to fend off bots,
      phishing, viruses, ransomware, exfiltration, and malware. That’s why small
      businesses need precisely the type of platform that we’ve developed at
      Brightgate: one that enables automated protection to prevent bad actors
      from misusing both your networks and the resources they connect. </p>
    <h3 id="the-power-of-machine-learning">Harness the power of machine learning</h3>
    <p>Brightgate observes your devices and their behavior all the time when
      they are on the network. Our machine learning creates a model of usual
      behavior on your network, so odd behavior is immediately identified. But
      we don’t stop with simply identifying odd behavior. We move a potentially
      infected device into quarantine to prevent it from infecting other devices
      on the network, then limit its network access until the issue is resolved.
      In addition, we notify the device's owner and network administrator of the
      issue, using language that’s easily understood, and suggest appropriate
      actions to take so the device can be safely updated or sanitized and again
      permitted access to the network. We'll even help you with remote IT to
      resolve the problem. Brightgate also blocks online destinations that we
      know are bad news—phishing, malware, and spyware. The Brightgate security
      team also stays on top of the latest threats. We automatically update
      every platform to defend against each new threat, covering your entire
      network—all your devices—all the time.</p>
    <h3 id="protect-your-data">Protect your data</h3>
    <p>Brightgate gets it. Small businesses like yours are very good at the
      skills your business was founded on—whether it’s designing systems,
      serving a meal, or offering consulting services. The core competence of
      your business is not in network security, but <b>ours is</b>. We
      understand that you need to adopt technologies that matter to your
      business without fear that you're putting your business at risk. As the
      technology you adopt becomes more sophisticated and interconnected, your
      risk of exposure to bad actors increases. Cybersecurity should, then, be a
      critical part of your technology focus. Until now, though, this has not
      been the case. Network security has been, at best, an afterthought as
      cybersecurity offerings have been both too complex and too expensive, and
      many small business owners like you have been unable to find a solution
      that scales appropriately, focusing too much either on home user needs or
      on enterprise requirements.</p>
    <h3 id="easy-onboarding">Easy onboarding</h3>
    <p>Brightgate solves the problem of overly complex solutions with an
      intelligent, easy-to-use solution that secures your network. We use a
      simple approach to configuration and onboarding, automating most decisions
      and implementation. This removes the need for highly technical, expensive
      staff. Our simple subscription model make your network security spend more
      efficient. And, our technology scales to your business, hitting the sweet
      spot between a home office and a large enterprise.</p>
    <h3 id="constant-monitoring">Constant monitoring, immediate notification</h3>
    <p>With Brightgate, you know which devices are on your network; what those
      devices are doing on the Internet, whether data is being passed out of
      your network, and to where; whether devices on your network are using a
      default password; and who has been provided guest network access.
      Importantly, Brightgate technology quarantines devices that are acting out
      of character, protecting your network from infection. We also notice if
      data has been or is being sent to known bad actors, and we can identify
      the amount of data sent.</p>
    <h3 id="ease-ofuse">Ease of use</h3>
    <p>Brightgate is designed to ensure your business can easily reap the
      benefits of automated cybersecurity. The simplicity of managing our
      cybersecurity solution, with alerts that make the issue easy to understand
      and specify the level of urgency, makes Brightgate’s technology easy to
      administer. </p>
    <p>Your Brightgate appliance helps you easily and quickly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add people and their devices to your network</li>
      <li>Terminate network access</li>
      <li>Grant temporary (“guest”) network access</li>
      <li>Identify devices that are acting suspiciously to reduce cybersecurity
        risks</li>
      <li>Protect your network from suspicious behavior</li>
      <li>Audit your network for compliance</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="prevent-ransomware-attacks">Prevent ransomware attacks</h3>
    <p>Besides the potential privacy issues, if your data is being held for
      ransom, reconstructing your data can be almost impossible and the ransom
      itself may be excruciatingly expensive. Brightgate is a valued partner to
      small businesses like yours searching for a zero administration answer to
      today’s cybersecurity risks.</p>
    <h2 id="how-we-secure">How we secure your business and customers</h2>
    <p> We built our product from the ground up, after extensive research, to
      ensure that a cybersecurity platform used by small businesses would be
      both easy to use and easy to administer. A couple of key ideas informed
      our design:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Access:</b> What devices should have access to this device access?
        And, looking at it from the opposite angle, what devices should this
        have device have access to?</li>
      <li><b>Trust:</b> How much do you trust this device when it's on your
        network?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We recognized that building a secure network means that devices
      fulfilling different functions in your business should be provided
      different types of access to one another. It's fundamental to our design:
      access is given where it's needed. Sometimes that's one-way. Important
      computers should be able to configure a thermostat, for example, but that
      thermostat shouldn't be allowed to attack those computers.</p>
    <p>Next, we designed a more secure method of authorizing devices to use your
      networks. We make it easy for every employee to have their own username
      and password to connect devices like laptops, tablets, or phones. Devices
      that share a common Wi-Fi password, like thermostats or light switches,
      are on a separate network.</p>
    <p>The end result? We created <b><i>trust groups</i></b></p>
    <h3 id="trust-groups">Trust groups</h3>
    <p>The Brightgate platform assigns each device connected to your network
      into a <b>trust group</b>—a logical grouping of connected devices. We
      make it easy to manage your network by providing default trust groups and
      automating trust group assignment of every device.</p>
    <p>Trust groups are how we protect the devices on your network and reduce
      the risk that malware or viruses will spread. The trust group to which a
      device is assigned affects both the level of trust for this device and the
      device's access to to other devices when it is on your network. Devices
      within a trust group communicate with and have access both to other
      devices assigned to that trust group and to devices assigned to trust
      groups that are less trusted and known.</p>
    <p>The less we know and trust a device, the less access we should give that
      device. That keeps untrusted devices from accessing or attacking other
      devices on your network.</p>
    <h4 id="network-authentication-and-trust-groups">Network authentication and
      trust groups work together</h4>
    <p>The way you add a device to your network affects the trust group we
      assign that device into. Think of it this way: phones and laptops owned by
      employees present a different type of risk than a Wi-Fi enabled
      thermostat. While the various types of authentication are beyond the scope
      of this guide, it's helpful to understand that Brightgate supports
      different types of network authentication, which all use WPA2. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>An Authorized User network that uses Extensible Authentication
        Protocol (EAP). With this type of network, each network user has their
        own login ID and password. You can read more about EAP in this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Authentication_Protocol">helpful
          article from Wikipedia</a></li>
      <li>A Devices network that uses Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication. With
        this type of network, all network users share the same password. A
        pre-shared key (PSK) allows anyone who has the key to use the wireless
        network.</li>
      <li>A Guest network. With this type of network, a network user does not
        need a login ID, but is provided a password that periodically expires.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We recommend including the
      suffix in the network name so it is clear to people choosing from among
      them when adding a device or logging on for the first time. For example,
      Acme Corp would name the networks<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Acme-user</code>,<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Acme-device</code>,
      and<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Acme-guest</code><span>&nbsp;</span>when first
      setting up their network. During the Alpha program, Brightgate will set up
      your networks following this recommendation.</p>
    <h3 id="automated-trust-group-assignment">Automated trust group assignment</h3>
    <p>Brightgate automatically assigns each device to a network and trust
      group, following security policies that make sense based on the device’s
      function; thermostats, security cameras, and other Internet-enabled tools
      serve your organization in one way—phones and laptops serve your
      organization in an entirely different way. Each of these devices presents
      a different type of risk and requires a different ability to communicate
      with other devices. The result? We’ll assign them to different trust
      groups.</p>
    <p>Our assignment of devices into a trust group is the result of thoughtful
      planning, from both usability and security perspectives. A network
      administrator's laptop, for example, must be able to communicate with a
      Wi-Fi enabled thermostat to set it up properly, so the thermostat must be
      accessible to the laptop that wishes to use it. When a device is added to
      your network, Brightgate uses the type of authentication provided by the
      device as part of the process to assign it to a trust group. If that
      assignment doesn't suit your company policies, you can move the device as
      discussed in the section <a href="#change-device-trust-group">Change a
        device's trust group assignment</a>.</p>
    <p>A Wi-Fi enabled thermostat is a good example of why assignment into a
      trust group makes your network safer. You want a thermostat to be
      available to a known and trusted employee device, but you likely don't
      want a laptop assigned the <code>guest</code> trust group to communicate
      to that same thermostat. This makes sense—you typically don’t want guests
      adjusting your thermostat, nor do you want guest laptops communicating
      with and potentially infecting devices that you already trust. Moreover,
      the thermostat's <code>devices</code> trust group means that a rogue
      thermostat won't be attacking either guest or employee devices.</p>
    <p>The <code>core</code> trust group is most typically populated with
      devices owned by network administrators or devices that are critical to
      your business. Devices assigned to the <code>standard</code> trust group
      are typically employee laptops and phones. In this setup, should an
      employee laptop become infected with malware, that laptop will never be
      able to infect the network administrator devices in the <code>core</code>
      trust group. And the moment that laptop starts acting oddly, Brightgate
      moves it to <code>quarantine</code>, so it can't infect the devices in
      the <code>standard</code> trust group either.</p>
    <p>Devices that aren’t assigned to a trust group are <code>unenrolled</code>,
      which means they have not been explicitly granted access to the network.
      They will not have credentials or be able to use your network. The most
      common unenrolled devices will be IoT devices that have the correct shared
      Wi-Fi password (PSK) but have not been authorized by an administrator. To
      keep your network secure, we only permit network access to devices that
      have been assigned into a Brightgate trust group. This way, we can
      determine how trusted or known the device is, assign it to an appropriate
      trust group, and watch the device's behavior to keep your network secure.</p>
    <p>Devices added to the Authorized User network are automatically added to
      the <code>standard</code> trust group, though administrators may move
      them to a different trust group, as discussed in the section <a href="#change-device-trust-group">Change
        a device's trust group assignment</a>. Devices added to the Devices
      network are automatically assigned to the <code>devices</code> trust
      group. And guests are assigned to the <code>guest</code> trust group.</p>

    <h4 id="default-trust-groups">Default trust groups</h4>
    <p>The Brightgate appliance provides a default set of trust groups, so
      network administration isn’t a chore. During the alpha program, the
      default trust group is the trust group into which a device is initially
      enrolled. Devices authenticated using EAP are automatically added to the <code>standard</code>
      trust group. Devices authenticated using PSK are automatically assigned to
      the <code>devices</code> trust group. Administrators can move devices to
      a different trust group, as discussed in the section <a href="#change-device-trust-group">Change
        a device's trust group assignment</a>.</p>
    <p>View the default trust groups for your network as discussed in the
      section <a href="#network-configuration">View your Network Details</a>,
      which lists the <i>Trust Group Configuration for each network</i>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For the <code>*-users</code> network:
        <ul>
          <li><code>core</code>: The trust group reserved for the most trusted
            devices</li>
          <li><code>standard</code>: The trust group most appropriate for
            devices owned by regular members of your team</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For the <code>*-device </code>network:
        <ul>
          <li><code>devices</code>: The trust group for Internet of Things (IoT)
            devices, such as thermostats or security cameras</li>
          <li><code>quarantine</code>: The trust group for devices that are
            behaving oddly</li>
          <li><code>unenrolled</code>: The trust group for all manually
            configured IoT devices or other unknown devices.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For the <code>*-guest</code> network:
        <ul>
          <li><code>guest</code>: The trust group for devices that require
            temporary network access</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="quarantined-devices">Quarantined devices</h3>
    <p>Quarantined devices are separated from other devices on your network to
      prevent potential infection and maintain security. Quarantine serves as a
      virtual “jail”. It’s where we put devices that look like they might be
      infected with a virus or bot. In short, we’re preventing devices that
      exhibit odd or suspicious behavior from communicating with the Internet as
      well as with other devices on your network. Quarantine stops devices from
      infecting other devices, allowing you to investigate them (with our
      helpful suggestions) and fix the issue at hand.</p>
    <p>For example, if a thermostat assigned to the <code>devices</code> trust
      group begins slowly dripping data to a URL with an unusual address or if
      an automated security check of a laptop fails, the suspicious device is
      automatically removed from its assigned trust group and moved to <code>quarantine</code>.</p>
    <p>You’ll get an alert when a vulnerability is identified and we'll move the
      affected device into quarantine. We’ll also include information about why
      we moved the device into quarantine. Once the identified issue is
      resolved, the device is returned to the network and its previously
      assigned trust group.</p>

    <p>Administering networks managed by Brightgate doesn't require constant
      oversight because we're doing so much behind the scenes. We're constantly
      monitoring your network and device behavior for vulnerabilities as well as
      managing the trust group assignment for your devices. As a result, with
      Brightgate, administration of your network involves the following tasks:</p>

    <h3 id="set-up-your-networks">Set up your networks</h3>
    <p>You'll need to set up your Wi-Fi networks to start using the security
      features of the Brightgate appliance. We'll set up your Wi-Fi networks for
      you during the Alpha program, but it's helpful to know the overall
      process.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Wired ports are also available. During the Alpha program, a
      device or switch plugged into a wired port will be assigned the <code>standard</code>
      trust group. In a future release, you will be able to change the trust
      group assignment for a port's connected devices ando require that a device
      connected to a port present an 802.1X credential to be added to a network.
      (Similar to WPA2-EAP.) </p>
    <p>Start by deciding whether you're:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating a new Wi-Fi network. If you've never had a network at this
        location, then you'll start with creating a new network. The
        instructions to create a new network are explained in the section <a href="#create-new-network">Create
          a new network</a></li>
      <li>Replacing an existing Wi-Fi network. If you're replacing an existing
        network, the decision about whether to re-use the network name and
        password is based on the level to which you trust the current network.
        If you trust what you've administered previously, then, by all means,
        re-use the network name and password. If you're uncertain, then create a
        new network name and password. During the Alpha program, overlaying an
        existing Wi-Fi network requires Brightgate support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> The network name is also called a Service Set ID (SSID). If you don't
      know what that is, you're welcome to read more about it in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_%28802.11_network%29#Service_Set_ID_%28SSID%29">helpful
        article from Wikipedia.</a></p>
    <p>This graphic illustrates the basic process of deciding how to set up your
      network:</p>
    <p><img src="./images/setup_flow.png" alt="Setup process for administrators"></p>
    <p>As discussed in <a href="#network-authentication-and-trust-groups">network
        authentication and trust groups work together</a>, Brightgate creates
      three networks based on the method a device uses to authenticate to the
      network: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>User:</b> each network user has their own login ID and password.</li>
      <li><b>Device:</b> all network users share the same password.</li>
      <li><b>Guest:</b> a network user does not need a login ID, but is provided
        a password that periodically rotates.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="create-new-network">Create a new network</h3>
    <p>When you first set up your Brightgate appliance, you'll need to name your
      networks to reflect the SSID, or network name, that you would like to use
      at your site. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Log in to the Brightgate management app</li>
      <li>(Optional) Select your site from the list</li>
      <li>Select <b>Networks</b> to view the complete list of
        Brightgate-secured networks. <b>Note:</b> The default network names are
        <code>setme-users</code>, <code>setme-devices</code>, and <code>setme-guest</code>.</li>
      <li>Click the network or the right-facing arrow (&gt;) to display <b>Network
          Details</b>. </li>
      <li>Select the red <b>Settings</b> icon <img src="./images/settings-icon.png"
          alt="Settings icon">.</li>
      <li>Edit the <b>SSID (Network Name)</b> to the name you'd prefer, then
        press <b>SAVE</b>. <b>Note:</b> Maintain the suffix of <code>-users</code>,
        <code>-devices</code>, or <code>-guest</code> to more easily
        differentiate among your Brightgate-secured networks.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="help-your-team-get-online">Help your team get online</h3>
    <p>The Brightgate management app supports Google Sign-In and Sign-In with
      Microsoft. <b>Note:</b> During the Alpha program, only Google Sign-In and
      Sign-In with Microsoft are supported for user logins. Other identity
      providers will be available in future releases.</p>
    <p>When you're logging in to the Brightgate management app (or if you're
      having your team log in), we authenticate you with your Google or
      Microsoft account, then walk you through creating and storing a Wi-Fi user
      name and password. Everyone needs to store their Wi-Fi user name and
      password to add other devices (like phones and tablets) to the Wi-Fi
      network reserved for authenticated users(typically the one with the suffix
      <code>-user</code>).</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Navigate to your <a href="https://svc1.b10e.net">Brightgate
          management app</a></li>
      <li>Press the <b>Login with Google</b> or <b>Login with Microsoft</b>

      <li>Use your Wi-Fi user name and password to add devices </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="help-your-team-add-devices">Help your team add their devices</h3>
    <p>Add devices that use both your user ID and Wi-Fi password to the <code>*-user</code>
      network. These are typically devices you own that use the Wi-Fi user name
      and password created in the Brightgate management app, such as a laptop,
      phone, or tablet. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#add-mac-network">Add a Mac to your network</a></li>

    </ul>
    <h4 id="quick-word-certificates">A quick word about certificates</h4>
    <p>The first time a device connects to the authenticated users network, in
      most cases the device will present a certificate for you to accept. This
      certificate confirms that the network is what it says it is, and accepting
      the certificate allows you to trust this network in the future when you
      connect the device without manual intervention.</p>
    <p>While your IT team is best qualified to help you understand how
      certificates are used in your environment, Brightgate suggests you inspect
      any certificate before adding it to your device. While the method of
      inspection varies according to the device type, ensure the certificate is
      issued by Let's Encrypt, the certificate authority used by Brightgate, and
      that the Subject Name looks like <code><i>number</i>.brightgate.net</code>,
      where <code><i>number</i></code> is a five digit number. The Trust level
      should be set to <i>Always Trust</i> for <b>EAP</b> and <b>Basic Policy</b>,
      if that level of specificity is available on your device. </p>

    <p>Brightgate secures your networks automatically, working in the background
      scanning every device added to your Brightgate networks, all the time. As
      a result, administrators don't need to actively secure a Brightgate
      network—compliance with security policies is enforced through the process
      of authenticating users, then adding their devices to the network as well
      as during our constant vigilance of network activity—unless alerted to do
      so by the Brightgate appliance. This type of alert occurs if we find a

    <h3 id="view-devices-network">View devices on the network</h3>
    <p>To view all devices on the network, from the main menu, <i>select your
        site &gt; Manage Devices.</i> The parentheses next to Manage Devices is
      the total number of all devices enrolled across all Brightgate-secured
      networks for your organization.</p>
    <p><img src="./images/manage-devices.png" alt="Manage devices"></p>
    <h3 id="remove-devices">Remove devices</h3>
    <p>Brightgate tracks device behavior based on those that are authenticated
      to the network. As a result, devices are not explicitly removed from a
      Brightgate network. Instead, the credentials used to add the device to the
      network must be revoked. </p>
    <p>In a future release, the user name and password associated with the user
      who added the device to network will be revoked when their Google
      credentials expire, which will prevent the device from being added to the
      network with credentials that are no longer in use by the organization. <b><br>
      </b></p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>If the removal of a device is required, move the device to
      the <code>unenrolled</code> trust group as described in the section <a href="#change-device-trust-group">Change
        a device's trust group assignment</a> or contact Brightgate support for
      assistance.</p>
    <h3 id="change-device-trust-group">Change a device's trust group assignment</h3>
    <p>Trust groups are how Brightgate protects the devices on your network and
      reduces the risk that malware or viruses will spread. The trust group to
      which a device is assigned affects both the level of trust for this device
      and the device's access to to other devices when it is on your network.
      Devices within a trust group communicate with and have access to both
      other devices assigned to that trust group and devices assigned to trust
      groups that are less trusted and known.</p>
    <p>Devices that aren’t assigned to a trust group are<span>&nbsp;</span><code>unenrolled</code>,
      which means they have not been explicitly granted access to the network.
      They will not have credentials or be able to use your network. The most
      common <code>unenrolled</code> devices will be IoT devices that have the
      correct shared Wi-Fi password (PSK) but have not been authorized by an
      administrator. To keep your network secure, we only permit network access
      to devices that have been assigned into a Brightgate trust group. This
      way, we can determine how trusted or known the device is, assign it to an
      appropriate trust group, and watch the device's behavior to keep your
      network secure. </p>
    <p><b>Important:</b> During the Alpha program, all devices added to the <code>*-device</code>
      network will be assigned to the <code>unenrolled</code> trust group.
      Administrators will need to explicitly move devices to the appropriate
      trust group to approve the addition of a device to this network.</p>
    <p>To change a device's trust group assignment, from the main menu, <i>select
        your site &gt; Manage Devices &gt; click the device name</i> to view the
      Device Details. The trust group and their intended purpose are as follows:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>core</code>:</dt>
      <dd>The trust group reserved for the most trusted devices.</dd>
      <dt><code>devices</code>:</dt>
      <dd>The trust group for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as
        thermostats or security cameras</dd>
      <dt><code>guest</code>:</dt>
      <dd>The trust group for devices that require temporary network access</dd>
      <dt><code>quarantine</code>:</dt>
      <dd>The trust group for devices that are behaving oddly</dd>
      <dt><code>standard</code>:</dt>
      <dd>The trust group most appropriate for devices owned by regular members
        of your team</dd>
      <dt><code>unenrolled</code>:</dt>
      <dd>The trust group for all manually configured IoT devices or other
        unknown devices.</dd>
      <dt><code>internal</code>:</dt>
      <dd>Reserved for Brightgate use.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>From <i>Access Control</i>, display the available <i>Trust Group</i>
      choices, then select the appropriate trust group to which to move the
      device. In the example, the device is being moved into the <code>standard</code>
      trust group:</p>

    </ol>
    <p>Users with administrative privileges can use <i>all</i> parts of the
      Brightgate management app, all of which are covered in this guide.
      Administration of a Brightgate-secured network requires a change in
      privilege for a defined user. During the Alpha program, this privilege
      change can be enabled only by calling Brightgate. </p>
    <p>To view users created for the Brightgate cloud, from the main menu, <i>select

    <p><b>Note:</b> In certain circumstances, an administrator may need access
      to only the local appliance, such as when Internet connectivity is lost.
      In this case, a <i>Site-Local Administrator</i> displays. Additional
      site-local administrators may be added by using the + icon; however,
      during the Alpha program, we recommend calling Brightgate for assistance
      if this type of user is required.</p>
