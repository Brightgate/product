    <p>This guide helps you manage your Brightgate platform during our Alpha program.</p>
    <h2 id="why-brightgate"><a name="why-brightgate">Why Brightgate</a></h2>
    <p> Business networks are under attack. And attacks are
      becoming more and more automated. As a result, your data — the lifeblood
      of your business, from accounts receivable to contracts to your customer's
      data <i>and</i> the devices that process it — present an
      ever-increasing risk. While big enterprises can spend millions on a team
      of IT experts, and the systems those experts require, small businesses
      don't have that kind of budget or technical knowledge. So hackers
      increasingly target small businesses. Small businesses need an automated
      response to fend off bots, phishing, viruses, ransomware, and malware. That’s why
      small businesses need precisely the type of platform that we’ve developed
      at Brightgate, one that enables automated protection to prevent bad actors
      from misusing both your Wi-Fi and wired network. </p>
    <h3 id="the-power-of-machine-learning">Harness the power of machine learning</h3>
    <p>Brightgate observes your devices and their behavior all the time when
      they are on the network. Our machine learning creates a model of usual
      behavior on your network, so odd behavior is immediately identified. But
      we don’t stop with simply identifying odd behavior. We move a potentially
      infected device into quarantine to prevent it from infecting other devices
      on the network, then limit its network access until the issue is
      resolved. In addition, we notify the device's owner and network
      administrator of the issue, using language that’s easily understood, and
      suggest appropriate actions to take so the device can be safely updated or
      sanitized and again permitted access to the network. We'll even help you with remote IT to resolve the problem. Brightgate also
      blocks online destinations that we know are bad news—phishing, malware,
      and spyware. The Brightgate security team also stays on top of the latest
      threats. We automatically update every platform to defend against each new threat,
      covering your entire network—all your devices—all the time.</p>
    <h3 id="protect-your-data">Protect your data</h3>
    <p>Brightgate gets it. Small businesses like yours are very good at the
      skills your business was founded on—whether it’s designing
      systems, serving a meal, or offering consulting services. The core
      competence of your business is not in network security, <em>ours is</em>.
      We understand that you need to adopt technologies that matter to your
      business without fear that you're putting your business at risk. As the
      technology you adopt becomes more sophisticated and interconnected, your
      risk of exposure to bad actors increases. Cybersecurity should, then, be a
      critical part of your technology focus. Until now, though, this has not
      been the case. Network security has been, at best, an afterthought as
      cybersecurity offerings have been both too complex and too expensive, and
      many small business owners like you have been unable to find a solution that scales
      appropriately, focusing too much either on home user needs or on
      enterprise requirements.</p>
    <h3 id="easy-onboarding">Easy onboarding</h3>
    <p>Brightgate solves the problem of overly complex solutions with an
      intelligent, easy-to-use solution that secures your network. We use a simple approach 
      to configuration and onboarding, automating most decisions and implementation. This 
      removes the need for highly technical, expensive staff. And our simple subscription model maximizes
      your network security spend. Last, our technology scales to your business,
      hitting the sweet spot between a home office and a large
      enterprise.</p>
    <h3 id="constant-monitoring">Constant monitoring, immediate notification</h3>
    <p>With Brightgate, you know which devices are on your network; what those
      devices are doing on the Internet, whether data is being passed out of
      your network, and to where; whether devices on your network using a
      default password; and who has been provided guest network access.
      Importantly, Brightgate technology quarantines devices that are acting out
      of character, protecting your network from infection. We also notice if
      data has been or is being sent to known bad actors, and we can identify
      the amount of data sent.</p>
    <h3 id="ease-ofuse">Ease of use</h3>
    <p>Brightgate is designed to ensure your business can easily reap the benefits of automated cybersecurity. 
      The simplicity of managing our cybersecurity solution, with
      alerts that make the issue easy to understand and specify the level of
      urgency make Brightgate’s technology easy to administer. </p>
    <p>Your Brightgate appliance helps you easily and quickly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add people and their devices to your network</li>
      <li>Terminate network access</li>
      <li>Grant temporary (“guest”) network access</li>
      <li>Identify devices that are acting suspiciously to reduce cybersecurity
        risks</li>
      <li>Protect your network from suspicious behavior</li>
      <li>Audit your network for compliance</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="prevent-ransomware-attacks">Prevent ransomware attacks</h3>
    <p>Besides the potential privacy issues, if your data is being held for
      ransom, reconstructing your data can be almost impossible and the ransom
      itself may be excruciatingly expensive. Brightgate is a valued partner to
      small businesses like yours searching for a zero administration answer to
      today’s cybersecurity risks.</p>
    <h2 id="how-we-secure"><a name="brightgate-basics">How we secure your
        business and customers</a></h2>
    <p> We built our product from the ground up, after extensive research, to ensure
      that a cybersecurity platform used by small businesses would be both easy
      to use and easy to administer. A couple of key ideas informed our design:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Access:</b> What devices should have access to this device access? And, looking at
        it from the opposite angle, what devices should this have device have access to?</li>
      <li><b>Trust:</b> How much do you trust this device when it's on your
        network?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We recognized that building a secure network meant that devices that
      fulfill different functions in your business should be provided different
      types of access to one another. It's fundamental to our design: access is 
      given where it's needed. Sometimes that's one-way. Important computers 
      should be able to configure a thermostat, for example, but that thermostat 
      shouldn't be allowed to attack those computers.</p>
    <p>Next, we designed a more secure method of authorizing devices to use your networks. 
      We make it easy for every employee to have their own username and password to connect 
      devices like laptops, tablets, or phones. Devices that share a common Wi-Fi password, 
      like thermostats or light switches, are on a separate network.</p>
    <p>The end result?... TRUST GROUPS!</p>
    <h3 id="trust-groups"><a name="trust-groups">Trust groups</a></h3>
    <p>The Brightgate platform assigns each device connected to your network
      into a <em>trust group</em>—a logical grouping of connected
      devices. We make it easy to manage your network by providing default trust
      groups and automating trust group assignment of every device.<strong>
        Note: </strong>Until a device is assigned to a trust group, the device
      can't use your network. </p>
    <p>Trust groups are how we protect the devices on your network and reduce the risk that malware or viruses will spread. The trust group to which a
      device is assigned affects both the level of trust for this device and the
      device's access to to other devices when it is on your network. Devices
      within a trust group communicate with and have access to both other
      devices assigned to that trust group and devices assigned to trust groups
      that are less trusted and known.</p>
    <p>The less we know and trust a device, the less access we should give that device. 
      That keeps untrusted devices from accessing or attacking other devices on your network.</p>
    <h4 id="network-authentication-and-trust-groups"><a name="network-authentication-and-trust-groups">Network
        authentication and trust groups work together</a></h4>
    <p>The way you add a device to your network affects the trust group we assign that device into. Think of it
      this way: phones and laptops owned by employees present a different type
      of risk and trust than a Wi-Fi enabled thermostat. While the various types
      of authentication are beyond the scope of this guide, it's helpful to
      understand that Brightgate supports different types of network
      authentication, which all use WPA2. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), where each network user has
        their own login ID and password.You can read more about EAP in this <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Authentication_Protocol">helpful
          article from Wikipedia</a> </li>
      <li>Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication, where all network users share the
        same password. A pre-shared key (PSK) allows anyone who has the key to
        use the wireless network.</li>
      <li>guest, where all visitors are provided a rotating password that
        periodically expires.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We recommend including the
      suffix in the network name so it is clear to people choosing from among
      them when adding a device or logging on for the first time. For example,
      Acme Corp should name the networks<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Acme-eap</code>,<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Acme-psk</code>,
      and<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Acme-guest</code><span>&nbsp;</span>when first
      setting up their network.<span> </span>During the Alpha program,
      Brightgate will set up your networks following this recommendation.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3 id="automated-trust-group-assignment"><a name="automated-trust-group-assignment">Automated
        trust group assignment</a></h3>
    <p>Brightgate automatically assigns each device into a trust group,
      following security policies that make sense based on the device’s
      function; thermostats, security cameras, and other Internet-enabled tools
      serve your organization in one way - phones and laptops serve your
      organization in an entirely different way. Each of these devices presents
      a different type of risk and requires a different ability to communicate
      with other devices. The result? We’ll assign them different trust groups.</p>
    <p>Our assignment of devices into a trust group is the result of thoughtful
      planning, from both usability and security perspectives. A network
      administrator's laptop, for example, must be able to communicate a with
      Wi-Fi enabled thermostat to set it up properly, so the thermostat must be
      accessible to the laptop that wishes to use it. When a device is added to
      your network, Brightgate uses the type of authentication provided by the
      device as part of the process to assign it to a trust group. If that
      assignment doesn't suit your company policies, you can move the device as
      discussed in<span> </span><a href="#changing-a-devices-trust-group-assignment">changing
        a device's trust group assignment</a>.</p>
    <p>A Wi-Fi enabled thermostat is a good example of why assignment into a
      trust group makes your network safer. You want a thermostat to be
      available to a known and trusted employee device, but you likely don't
      want a laptop assigned the <code>guest</code> trust group to communicate
      to that same thermostat. This makes sense — you typically don’t want
      guests adjusting your thermostat, nor do you want guest laptops
      communicating with and potentially infecting devices that you already
      trust. Moreover, the thermostat's <code>devices</code> trust group means that a 
      rogue thermostat won't be attacking either guest or employee devices.</p>
    <p>The <code>core</code> trust group is most typically populated with
      devices owned by network administrators or devices that are critical to
      your business. Devices assigned to the <code>standard</code> trust group
      are typically employee laptops and phones. In this set up, should an
      employee laptop become infected with malware, that laptop will never be
      able to infect the network administrator devices in the <code>core</code>
      trust group. And the moment that laptop starts acting oddly, Brightgate
      moves it to <code>quarantine</code>, so it can't infect the devices in
      the <code>standard</code> trust group either.</p>
    <p>Devices that aren’t assigned to a trust group are<span>&nbsp;</span><code>unenrolled</code>,
      which means they have not been explicitly granted access to the network. They will not have 
      credentials or be able to use your network. The most common <code>unenrolled</code> devices 
      will be IoT devices that have the correct shared Wi-Fi password (PSK) but have not 
      been authorized by an administrator. To keep your network secure, we only permit network access to devices that
      have been assigned into a Brightgate trust group. This way, we can
      determine how trusted or known the device is, assign it to an appropriate
      trust group, and watch the device's behavior to keep your network secure.</p>
    <p>Devices added to the EAP network are automatically added to the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>standard</code><span>&nbsp;</span>trust
      group, though administrators may move them to a different trust group as
      discussed in<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="#changing-a-devices-trust-group-assignment">changing
        a device's trust group assignment</a>. Devices added to the PSK network
      are automatically assigned to the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>devices</code><span>&nbsp;</span>trust
      group. And guests are assigned to the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>guest</code><span>&nbsp;</span>trust
      group.</p>

    <h4 id="default-trust-groups"><a name="default-trust-groups">Default trust
        groups</a></h4>
    <p>The Brightgate appliance provides a default set of trust groups, so
      network administration isn’t a chore. During the alpha program, the
      default trust group is the trust group into which a device is initially
      enrolled. Devices authenticated using EAP are automatically added to the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>standard</code><span>&nbsp;</span>trust
      group. Devices authenticated using PSK are automatically assigned to the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>devices</code><span>&nbsp;</span>trust
      group. Administrators can move devices to a different trust group as
      discussed in<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="#changing-a-devices-trust-group-assignment">changing
        a device's trust group assignment</a>.</p>
    <p>View the trust groups by selecting your site from the list, then the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Site
        Status</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>page. The<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Trust
        Group Configuration</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lists the trusts groups:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>core</code>: The trust group reserved for the most trusted devices.</li>
      <li><code>devices</code>: The trust group for Internet of
        Things (IoT) devices, such as thermostats or security cameras</li>
      <li><code>guest</code>: The trust group for devices that require temporary
        network access</li>
      <li><code>quarantine</code>: The trust group for devices
        that are behaving oddly</li>
      <li><code>standard</code>: The trust group most appropriate for devices
        owned by regular members of your team</li>
      <li><code>unenrolled</code>: The trust group for all manually configured IoT devices or other unknown devices.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="quarantined-devices"><a name="quarantined-devices">Quarantined
        devices</a></h3>
    <p>Quarantined devices are separated from other devices on your network to
      prevent potential infection and maintain security. Quarantine serves as a
      virtual “jail”. It’s where we put devices that look like they might be infected with a virus or bot. In
      short, we’re preventing devices that exhibit odd or suspicious behavior
      from communicating with the Internet as well as with other devices on your
      network. Quarantine stops devices from infecting other devices, allowing
      you to investigate them (with our helpful suggestions) and fix the issue
      at hand.</p>
    <p>For example, if a thermostat assigned to the <code>Devices</code> trust
      group begins slowly dripping data to a URL with an unusual address or if
      an automated security check of a laptop fails, the suspicious device is
      automatically removed from its assigned trust group and moved to<span>&nbsp;</span><code>quarantine</code>.</p>
    <p>You’ll get an alert when a vulnerability is identified and we'll move the
      affected device into quarantine. We’ll also include information about why
      we moved the device into quarantine. Once the identified issue is
      resolved, the device is returned to the network and its previously
      assigned trust group.</p>
